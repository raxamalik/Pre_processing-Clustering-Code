His father created him 10th Duke of Braganza.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'After the 1653 death of his eldest brother TeodÃ³sio, Prince of Brazil, Afonso became the heir-apparent to the throne of the kingdom. He received also the crown-princely title 2nd Prince of Brazil.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'== Succession ==\\\\n\\', \\'Portrait of Infante Afonso; JosÃ© de Avelar Rebelo, 1653.\\\\n\\', \"He succeeded his father (JoÃ£o IV) in 1656 at the age of thirteen. His mother, Luisa of Medina-Sidonia, was named regent in his father\\'s will. His mental instability and paralysis, plus his lack of interest in government, left his mother as regent for six years, until 1662. Afonso oversaw decisive military victories over the Spanish at Elvas (14 January 1659), Ameixial (8 June 1663) and Montes Claros (17 June 1665), culminating in the final Spanish recognition of sovereignty of Portugal\\'s new ruling dynasty, the House of Braganza, on 13 February 1668 in the Treaty of Lisbon.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'== Colonial Affairs ==\\\\n\\', \"Colonial affairs saw the Dutch conquest of Jaffnapatam, Portugal\\'s last colony in Portuguese Ceylon (1658) and the cession of Bombay and Tangier to England (23 June 1661) as dowry for Afonso\\'s sister, Catherine of Braganza, who had married King Charles II of England. English mediation in 1661 saw the Netherlands acknowledge Portuguese rule of Brazil in return for uncontested control of Ceylon.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In 1662, the Count of Castelo Melhor saw an opportunity to gain power at court by befriending the king. He managed to convince the king that his mother was out to steal his throne and exile him from Portugal. As a result, Afonso took control of the throne and his mother was sent to a convent.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'== Marriage ==\\\\n\\', \"He was married to Marie FranÃ§oise of Nemours, the daughter of the Duke of Savoy, in 1666, but the marriage did not last long. Marie FranÃ§oise, or Maria Francisca in Portuguese, filed for an annulment in 1667 based on the impotence of the king. The Church granted her the annulment, and she married Afonso\\'s brother, Pedro, Duke of Beja (the future Peter II).\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'== Deposition ==\\\\n\\', \\'That same year, Pedro managed to gain enough support to force the king to relinquish control of the government and he became Prince Regent in 1668. Afonso was exiled to the island of Terceira in the Azores for seven years, returning to mainland Portugal shortly before he died at Sintra in 1683.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"His trial is the basis of JoÃ£o MÃ¡rio Grilo\\'s 1990 film, The King\\'s Trial (O Processo do Rei).\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Ancestry==\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==References==\\\\n\\', \\'*\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'[[Alphonso I of Spain]]\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'There has not been a monarch known as Alphonso or Alfonso I of Spain, the first king of that name of the unified Spain being Alfonso XII of Spain (1874â\\\\x80\\\\x931885).\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Several precursor kingdoms have had an Alfonso I.

He was put under the guardianship of his aunt Adosinda after his father\\'s death, but one tradition relates his being put in the monastery of Samos. He was the governor of the palace during the reign of Adosinda\\'s husband Silo. On Silo\\'s death, he was elected king by Adosinda\\'s allies, but the magnates raised his uncle Mauregatus to the throne instead. Alfonso fled to Ã\\\\x81lava where he found shelter with his maternal relatives. Mauregatus was succeeded by Bermudo, Alfonso\\'s cousin, who abdicated after his defeat at the Battle of the Burbia River.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Alfonso proclaimed king==\\\\n\\', \\'Alfonso was subsequently elected king on 14 September 791. The events of his reign are in reality almost unknown. Poets of a later generation invented the story of the secret marriage of his sister Ximena to Sancho, count of Saldana, and the feats of their son Bernardo del Carpio. Bernardo is the hero of a cantar de gesta (chanson de geste) written to please the anarchical spirit of the nobles.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Andalusian raids into Asturias==\\\\n\\', \\'On accession to the throne, son of Abd ar-Rahman I Hisham I commenced a string of military campaigns to the eastern Pyrenees and to the north-west. In 794 a raid spearheaded by Abd al-Karim dealt a major military blow to Alfonso II on the eastern fringes of the Kingdom of Asturias (Cantabria and Castile). The Asturian king asked then for the assistance of the Basque Frankish vassal Belasco, master of Ã\\\\x81lava and bordering regions at the time. Abd al-Karim campaigned deeper west into Asturias, and pillaged the region, while his brother Abd al-Malik ventured into the western Asturian lands.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Relations with Charlemagne and the Papacy==\\\\n\\', \"Confronted with heavy fire, Alfonso II reached out to Charlemagne\\'s Franks. He sent delegations to Toulouse and Aix-la-Chapelle in 796, 797, and 798. These diplomacy efforts may have aimed to strengthen his legitimacy and the government structures of Asturias against ongoing internal unrestâ\\\\x80\\\\x94â\\\\x80\\\\x94troubles in Galiciaâ\\\\x80\\\\x94â\\\\x80\\\\x94and external attacks of the Ibn Mugait brothers, i.e. generals Abd al-Karim and Abd al-Malik.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \"Alfonso was acknowledged as a king by Charlemagne and the Pope, and Asturias as a kingdom for the first time. The king showed an interest in the Frankish cult of Saint Martin of Tours, and most notably he encouraged Carolingian Church influence into Asturias. Not surprisingly, during Alfonso\\'s reign the alleged resting-place of St. James was revealed. Alfonso\\'s envoys to Charlemagne\\'s courts may have also dealt with the adoptionist controversy, which had brought Bermudo\\'s kingdom into Charlemagne\\'s view. It seems that Carolingian support did much to spur his military raid into Andalusian territory up to Lisbon. The Andalusian city in turn was captured and sacked by his troops in 798.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Later events==\\\\n\\', \\'In 825 he defeated Cordovan forces at NarÃ³n and Anceo (825) and, thanks to these victories, the \"repopulation\" of parts of Galicia, LeÃ³n, and Castile was started&mdash;charter granting that confirmed the possession of the territories.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Alfonso also moved the capital from Pravia, where Silo had located it, to Oviedo, the city of his father\\'s founding and his birth. There he constructed churches and a palace. He built San Tirso, where he is buried, and Santullano, on the outskirts. The CrÃ³nica Sebastianense records his death in 842, saying:\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\':tras haber llevado por 52 aÃ±os casta, sobria, inmaculada, piadosa y gloriosamente el gobierno del reino\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\':having held for 52 years chastely, soberly, immaculately, piously, and gloriously the government of the realm\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Tradition relates that in 814, the body of Saint James the Greater was discovered in Compostela and that Alfonso was the first pilgrim to that famous medieval (and modern) shrine.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==References==\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'*\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'[[Amara Sinha]]\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Amara Sinha (or Simha ) (c. AD 375) was a Sanskrit grammarian and poet, of whose personal history hardly anything is known. He is said to have been \"one of the nine gems that adorned the throne of Vikramaditya,\" and according to the evidence of Hsuan Tsang, this is the Chandragupta Vikramaditya (Chandragupta II) that flourished about AD 375. Other sources describe him as flourishing in c. AD 700. \"Amara-Simha\" in Chambers\\\\\\'s EncyclopÃ¦dia. London: George Newnes, 1961, Vol. 1, p. 311. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Amara seems to have been a Buddhist, and most of his work was destroyed, with the exception of what is the celebrated Amara-Kosha (Treasury of Amara), a vocabulary of Sanskrit roots, in three books, and hence sometimes called Trikanda or the \"Tripartite\". It is also known as \"Namalinganushasana\".\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'It contains 10,000 words, and is arranged, like other works of its class, in metre, to aid the memory. The first chapter of the Kosha was printed at Rome in Tamil character in 1798. An edition of the entire work, with English notes and an index by HT Colebrooke, appeared at Serampore in 1808. The Sanskrit text was printed at Calcutta in 1831. A French translation by ALA Loiseleur-Deslongchamps as published at Paris in 1839. Louie Rice compiled the Kannada version of it and its available 4th edition was printed in 1927 which contains three khandas and 25 sargas.

His mother abdicated in his favour in 1870, and he returned to Spain as king in 1874 following a military coup. Alfonso died aged 27 in 1885, and was succeeded by his unborn son, who became Alfonso XIII on his birth the following year.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Political background, early life and paternity==\\\\n\\', \"Alfonso was the eldest son of Queen Isabella II of Spain. Officially, his father was her husband Francis, Duke of CÃ¡diz. Alfonso\\'s biological paternity is uncertain: there is speculation that his biological father may have been Enrique PuigmoltÃ³ y Mayans (a captain of the guard). Juan Sisinio PÃ©rez GarzÃ³n, Isabel II: Los Espejos de la Reina (2004) These rumours were used as political propaganda against Alfonso by the Carlists.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'His mother\\\\\\'s accession created the second cause of instability, which was the Carlist Wars. The supporters of the Count of Molina as king of Spain rose to have him enthroned. In addition, within the context of the post-Napoleonic restorations and revolutions which engulfed the West both in Europe and the Americas, both the Carlistas as well as the Isabelino conservatives were opposed to the new Napoleonic constitutional system. Much like in Britain, who subtracted itself from the liberal constitutional process, Spanish conservatives wanted to continue with the Traditional Spanish Organic Laws such as the Fuero Juzgo, the NovÃ\\\\xadsima RecopilaciÃ³n and the Partidas of Alfonso X. This led to the third cause of instability of worth, the \"Independence of the American Kingdoms\", recognized between 1823 and 1850.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==A split nation==\\\\n\\', \\'When Queen Isabella and her husband were forced to leave Spain by the Revolution of 1868, Alfonso accompanied them to Paris. From there, he was sent to the Theresianum at Vienna to continue his studies. On 25 June 1870, he was recalled to Paris, where his mother abdicated in his favour, in the presence of a number of Spanish nobles who had tied their fortunes to that of the exiled queen. He assumed the title of Alfonso XII, for although no King of united Spain had borne the name \"Alfonso XI\", the Spanish monarchy was regarded as continuous with the more ancient monarchy represented by the 11 kings of Asturias, LeÃ³n and Castile also named Alfonso.\\\\n\\', \\'Royal Monogram\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==The Republic==\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"After Amadeo\\'s abandonment in 1873, Parliament declared the Federal Republic (including Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Pacific Archipelagos), the first act of President Estanislao Figueras was to extend the Abolition Act to Puerto Rico. Cuban slaves would have to wait until 1889.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'But the republicans were not in agreement either, and they had to contend with the War in Cuba, Muslim uprisings in Spanish Morocco and the continuance of the Carlist Wars. This led to the creation of a group in favor of the Bourbon restoration, made by some sectors of the moderates led by Canovas del Castillo.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"The Prince of Asturias, Alfonso, was the person chosen to develop the new road map proposed by Canovas, which led to the June 1870 abdication of Queen Isabel II in favour of her son Prince Alfonso. The new road map which indeed ended the eternal crisis begun in 1810 was called \\'Alfonsismo\\' and the moderate centrist CÃ¡novas del Castillo became the spokesman. As having Alfonso in Spain, would be a problem CÃ¡novas became responsible for his education. So, he sent Alfonso to the Sandhurst Military Academy in England, where the training Alfonso received was severe but more cosmopolitan than Spain, given the current atmosphere.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \"In 1 December 1874, Alfonso issued the Sandhurst Manifesto, where he set the ideological basis of the Bourbon Restoration. It was drafted in reply to a birthday greeting from his followers, a manifesto proclaiming himself the sole representative of the Spanish monarchy. At the end of 1874, Brigadier MartÃ\\\\xadnez Campos, who had long been working more or less openly for the king, led some battalions of the central army to Sagunto, rallied to his own flag the troops sent against him, and entered Valencia in the king\\'s name. Thereupon the President resigned, and his power was transferred to the king\\'s plenipotentiary and adviser, Antonio CÃ¡novas. The 29 December 1874 military coup of Gen. Martinez Campos in Sagunto ended the failed republic and meant the rise of the young Prince Alfonso.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Return from exile==\\\\n\\', \\'Alfonso XII in the uniform of the Supreme Commander of the Spanish Navy.\\\\n\\', \\'5 Peseta of Alfonso XII\\\\n\\', \"Within a few days after Canovas del Castillo took power as Premier, the new king, proclaimed on 29 December 1874, arrived at Madrid, passing through Barcelona and Valencia and was acclaimed everywhere (1875). In 1876, a vigorous campaign against the Carlists, in which the young king took part, resulted in the defeat of Don Carlos and the Duke\\'s abandonment of the struggle.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Initially led by Canovas del Castillo as moderate prime minister, what was thought at one time as a coup aimed at placing the military in the political-administrative positions of power, in reality ushered in a permanent civilian regime that lasted until the 1931 Second Republic. CÃ¡novas was the real architect of the new regime of the Restoration.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"In order to eliminate one of the problems of the reign of Isabel II, the single party and its destabilizing consequences, the Liberal Party was allowed to incorporate and participate in national politics, and the \\'turnismo\\' or alternation was to become the new system. Turnismo would be endorsed in the Constitution of 1876 and the Pact of Pardo Palace (1885). It meant that a liberal and conservative prime ministers would succeed each other ending thus the troubles.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'This led to the end of the Carlist revolts and the victory over the New York-backed Cuban revolutionaries, and led to a huge backing both by insular and peninsular Spaniards of Alfonso as a wise and able king.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Alfonso\\'s short reign established the foundations for the final socioeconomic recuperation of Spain after the 1808â\\\\x80\\\\x931874 crisis. Both European (the coastal regions, such as the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Asturias) and Overseas â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Antilles and Pacific were able to grow steadily. Cuba and Puerto Rico prospered to the point that Spain\\'s first train was between Havana and Camaguey, and the world\\'s first telegraph was in Puerto Rico, as Samuel Morse lived there with his daughter, married to a Puerto Rican businessman. Upon the American invasion of Puerto Rico, 10 US dollars were needed to buy 1 Puerto Rican peso.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'On 23 January 1878 at the Basilica of Atocha in Madrid, Alfonso married his first cousin, Princess Maria de las Mercedes, daughter of Antoine, Duke of Montpensier, but she died within six months of the marriage.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Second marriage and rule==\\\\n\\', \\'Alfonso XII and his second wife Maria Christina of Austria, 1885.\\\\n\\', \\'On 29 November 1879 at the Basilica of Atocha in Madrid, Alfonso married a much more distant relative, Maria Christina of Austria, daughter of Archduke Karl Ferdinand of Austria and of his wife Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria.

Born posthumously. He married Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In 1881 Alfonso refused to sanction a law by which the ministers were to remain in office for a fixed term of 18 months. Upon the consequent resignation of Canovas del Castillo, he summoned PrÃ¡xedes Mateo Sagasta, the Liberal leader, to form a new cabinet.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Death and impact==\\\\n\\', \"Funeral procession of Alfonso XII, from the 5 December 1885, issue of L\\'Illustration\\\\n\", \\'Monument to Alfonso XII, erected in 1922 in the Parque del Buen Retiro, Madrid.\\\\n\\', \\'In November 1885, Alfonso died, just short of his 28th birthday, at the Royal Palace of El Pardo. He had been suffering from tuberculosis, but the immediate cause of his death was a recurrence of dysentery. \"Death of the King of Spain\", The Times (26 November 1885): 7. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"In 1902, his widow Maria Cristina initiated a national contest to build a monument in memory of Alfonso. The winning design, by JosÃ© Grases Riera, was erected in an artificial lake in Madrid\\'s Parque del Buen Retiro in 1922.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Coming to the throne at such an early age, Alfonso had served no apprenticeship in the art of ruling, but he possessed great natural tact and a sound judgment ripened by the trials of exile. Benevolent and sympathetic in disposition, he won the affection of his people by fearlessly visiting districts ravaged by cholera or devastated by earthquake in 1885. His capacity for dealing with men was considerable, and he never allowed himself to become the instrument of any particular party. During his short reign, peace was established both at home and abroad, finances were well regulated, and the various administrative services were placed on a basis that afterwards enabled Spain to pass through the disastrous war with the United States without the threat of a revolution.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Illegitimate issue==\\\\n\\', \\'Alfonso had two sons by Elena Armanda Nicolasa Sanz y MartÃ\\\\xadnez de Arizala (CastellÃ³n de la Plana, 15 December 1849 â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Paris, 24 December 1898):\\\\n\\', \\'* Alfonso Sanz y MartÃ\\\\xadnez de Arizala (28 January 1880, Madrid â\\\\x80\\\\x93 1970), married in 1922 to MarÃ\\\\xada de Guadalupe de Limantour y Mariscal (d. 1977, Marbella), daughter of Julio de Limantour y Marquet (17 June 1863, Mexico City â\\\\x80\\\\x93 11 October 1909, Mexico City) and wife Elena Mariscal y ..., paternal granddaughter of French Joseph Yves de Limantour y Rence de la Pagame (1812, Ploemeur â\\\\x80\\\\x93 1885, Mexico City) and wife AdÃ¨le Marquet y Cabannes (1820, Bordeaux â\\\\x80\\\\x93 ?), and maternal granddaughter of Ignacio Mariscal y ...

His father created him 10th Duke of Braganza.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'After the 1653 death of his eldest brother TeodÃ³sio, Prince of Brazil, Afonso became the heir-apparent to the throne of the kingdom. He received also the crown-princely title 2nd Prince of Brazil.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'== Succession ==\\\\n\\', \\'Portrait of Infante Afonso; JosÃ© de Avelar Rebelo, 1653.\\\\n\\', \"He succeeded his father (JoÃ£o IV) in 1656 at the age of thirteen. His mother, Luisa of Medina-Sidonia, was named regent in his father\\'s will. His mental instability and paralysis, plus his lack of interest in government, left his mother as regent for six years, until 1662. Afonso oversaw decisive military victories over the Spanish at Elvas (14 January 1659), Ameixial (8 June 1663) and Montes Claros (17 June 1665), culminating in the final Spanish recognition of sovereignty of Portugal\\'s new ruling dynasty, the House of Braganza, on 13 February 1668 in the Treaty of Lisbon.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'== Colonial Affairs ==\\\\n\\', \"Colonial affairs saw the Dutch conquest of Jaffnapatam, Portugal\\'s last colony in Portuguese Ceylon (1658) and the cession of Bombay and Tangier to England (23 June 1661) as dowry for Afonso\\'s sister, Catherine of Braganza, who had married King Charles II of England. English mediation in 1661 saw the Netherlands acknowledge Portuguese rule of Brazil in return for uncontested control of Ceylon.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In 1662, the Count of Castelo Melhor saw an opportunity to gain power at court by befriending the king. He managed to convince the king that his mother was out to steal his throne and exile him from Portugal. As a result, Afonso took control of the throne and his mother was sent to a convent.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'== Marriage ==\\\\n\\', \"He was married to Marie FranÃ§oise of Nemours, the daughter of the Duke of Savoy, in 1666, but the marriage did not last long. Marie FranÃ§oise, or Maria Francisca in Portuguese, filed for an annulment in 1667 based on the impotence of the king. The Church granted her the annulment, and she married Afonso\\'s brother, Pedro, Duke of Beja (the future Peter II).\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'== Deposition ==\\\\n\\', \\'That same year, Pedro managed to gain enough support to force the king to relinquish control of the government and he became Prince Regent in 1668. Afonso was exiled to the island of Terceira in the Azores for seven years, returning to mainland Portugal shortly before he died at Sintra in 1683.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"His trial is the basis of JoÃ£o MÃ¡rio Grilo\\'s 1990 film, The King\\'s Trial (O Processo do Rei).\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Ancestry==\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==References==\\\\n\\', \\'*\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'[[Alphonso I of Spain]]\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'There has not been a monarch known as Alphonso or Alfonso I of Spain, the first king of that name of the unified Spain being Alfonso XII of Spain (1874â\\\\x80\\\\x931885).\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Several precursor kingdoms have had an Alfonso I.

He was put under the guardianship of his aunt Adosinda after his father\\'s death, but one tradition relates his being put in the monastery of Samos. He was the governor of the palace during the reign of Adosinda\\'s husband Silo. On Silo\\'s death, he was elected king by Adosinda\\'s allies, but the magnates raised his uncle Mauregatus to the throne instead. Alfonso fled to Ã\\\\x81lava where he found shelter with his maternal relatives. Mauregatus was succeeded by Bermudo, Alfonso\\'s cousin, who abdicated after his defeat at the Battle of the Burbia River.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Alfonso proclaimed king==\\\\n\\', \\'Alfonso was subsequently elected king on 14 September 791. The events of his reign are in reality almost unknown. Poets of a later generation invented the story of the secret marriage of his sister Ximena to Sancho, count of Saldana, and the feats of their son Bernardo del Carpio. Bernardo is the hero of a cantar de gesta (chanson de geste) written to please the anarchical spirit of the nobles.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Andalusian raids into Asturias==\\\\n\\', \\'On accession to the throne, son of Abd ar-Rahman I Hisham I commenced a string of military campaigns to the eastern Pyrenees and to the north-west. In 794 a raid spearheaded by Abd al-Karim dealt a major military blow to Alfonso II on the eastern fringes of the Kingdom of Asturias (Cantabria and Castile). The Asturian king asked then for the assistance of the Basque Frankish vassal Belasco, master of Ã\\\\x81lava and bordering regions at the time. Abd al-Karim campaigned deeper west into Asturias, and pillaged the region, while his brother Abd al-Malik ventured into the western Asturian lands.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Relations with Charlemagne and the Papacy==\\\\n\\', \"Confronted with heavy fire, Alfonso II reached out to Charlemagne\\'s Franks. He sent delegations to Toulouse and Aix-la-Chapelle in 796, 797, and 798. These diplomacy efforts may have aimed to strengthen his legitimacy and the government structures of Asturias against ongoing internal unrestâ\\\\x80\\\\x94â\\\\x80\\\\x94troubles in Galiciaâ\\\\x80\\\\x94â\\\\x80\\\\x94and external attacks of the Ibn Mugait brothers, i.e. generals Abd al-Karim and Abd al-Malik.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \"Alfonso was acknowledged as a king by Charlemagne and the Pope, and Asturias as a kingdom for the first time. The king showed an interest in the Frankish cult of Saint Martin of Tours, and most notably he encouraged Carolingian Church influence into Asturias. Not surprisingly, during Alfonso\\'s reign the alleged resting-place of St. James was revealed. Alfonso\\'s envoys to Charlemagne\\'s courts may have also dealt with the adoptionist controversy, which had brought Bermudo\\'s kingdom into Charlemagne\\'s view. It seems that Carolingian support did much to spur his military raid into Andalusian territory up to Lisbon. The Andalusian city in turn was captured and sacked by his troops in 798.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Later events==\\\\n\\', \\'In 825 he defeated Cordovan forces at NarÃ³n and Anceo (825) and, thanks to these victories, the \"repopulation\" of parts of Galicia, LeÃ³n, and Castile was started&mdash;charter granting that confirmed the possession of the territories.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Alfonso also moved the capital from Pravia, where Silo had located it, to Oviedo, the city of his father\\'s founding and his birth. There he constructed churches and a palace. He built San Tirso, where he is buried, and Santullano, on the outskirts. The CrÃ³nica Sebastianense records his death in 842, saying:\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\':tras haber llevado por 52 aÃ±os casta, sobria, inmaculada, piadosa y gloriosamente el gobierno del reino\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\':having held for 52 years chastely, soberly, immaculately, piously, and gloriously the government of the realm\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Tradition relates that in 814, the body of Saint James the Greater was discovered in Compostela and that Alfonso was the first pilgrim to that famous medieval (and modern) shrine.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==References==\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'*\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'[[Amara Sinha]]\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Amara Sinha (or Simha ) (c. AD 375) was a Sanskrit grammarian and poet, of whose personal history hardly anything is known. He is said to have been \"one of the nine gems that adorned the throne of Vikramaditya,\" and according to the evidence of Hsuan Tsang, this is the Chandragupta Vikramaditya (Chandragupta II) that flourished about AD 375. Other sources describe him as flourishing in c. AD 700. \"Amara-Simha\" in Chambers\\\\\\'s EncyclopÃ¦dia. London: George Newnes, 1961, Vol. 1, p. 311. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Amara seems to have been a Buddhist, and most of his work was destroyed, with the exception of what is the celebrated Amara-Kosha (Treasury of Amara), a vocabulary of Sanskrit roots, in three books, and hence sometimes called Trikanda or the \"Tripartite\". It is also known as \"Namalinganushasana\".\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'It contains 10,000 words, and is arranged, like other works of its class, in metre, to aid the memory. The first chapter of the Kosha was printed at Rome in Tamil character in 1798. An edition of the entire work, with English notes and an index by HT Colebrooke, appeared at Serampore in 1808. The Sanskrit text was printed at Calcutta in 1831. A French translation by ALA Loiseleur-Deslongchamps as published at Paris in 1839.

His mother abdicated in his favour in 1870, and he returned to Spain as king in 1874 following a military coup. Alfonso died aged 27 in 1885, and was succeeded by his unborn son, who became Alfonso XIII on his birth the following year.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Political background, early life and paternity==\\\\n\\', \"Alfonso was the eldest son of Queen Isabella II of Spain. Officially, his father was her husband Francis, Duke of CÃ¡diz. Alfonso\\'s biological paternity is uncertain: there is speculation that his biological father may have been Enrique PuigmoltÃ³ y Mayans (a captain of the guard). Juan Sisinio PÃ©rez GarzÃ³n, Isabel II: Los Espejos de la Reina (2004) These rumours were used as political propaganda against Alfonso by the Carlists.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'His mother\\\\\\'s accession created the second cause of instability, which was the Carlist Wars. The supporters of the Count of Molina as king of Spain rose to have him enthroned. In addition, within the context of the post-Napoleonic restorations and revolutions which engulfed the West both in Europe and the Americas, both the Carlistas as well as the Isabelino conservatives were opposed to the new Napoleonic constitutional system. Much like in Britain, who subtracted itself from the liberal constitutional process, Spanish conservatives wanted to continue with the Traditional Spanish Organic Laws such as the Fuero Juzgo, the NovÃ\\\\xadsima RecopilaciÃ³n and the Partidas of Alfonso X. This led to the third cause of instability of worth, the \"Independence of the American Kingdoms\", recognized between 1823 and 1850.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==A split nation==\\\\n\\', \\'When Queen Isabella and her husband were forced to leave Spain by the Revolution of 1868, Alfonso accompanied them to Paris. From there, he was sent to the Theresianum at Vienna to continue his studies. On 25 June 1870, he was recalled to Paris, where his mother abdicated in his favour, in the presence of a number of Spanish nobles who had tied their fortunes to that of the exiled queen. He assumed the title of Alfonso XII, for although no King of united Spain had borne the name \"Alfonso XI\", the Spanish monarchy was regarded as continuous with the more ancient monarchy represented by the 11 kings of Asturias, LeÃ³n and Castile also named Alfonso.\\\\n\\', \\'Royal Monogram\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==The Republic==\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"After Amadeo\\'s abandonment in 1873, Parliament declared the Federal Republic (including Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Pacific Archipelagos), the first act of President Estanislao Figueras was to extend the Abolition Act to Puerto Rico. Cuban slaves would have to wait until 1889.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'But the republicans were not in agreement either, and they had to contend with the War in Cuba, Muslim uprisings in Spanish Morocco and the continuance of the Carlist Wars. This led to the creation of a group in favor of the Bourbon restoration, made by some sectors of the moderates led by Canovas del Castillo.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"The Prince of Asturias, Alfonso, was the person chosen to develop the new road map proposed by Canovas, which led to the June 1870 abdication of Queen Isabel II in favour of her son Prince Alfonso. The new road map which indeed ended the eternal crisis begun in 1810 was called \\'Alfonsismo\\' and the moderate centrist CÃ¡novas del Castillo became the spokesman. As having Alfonso in Spain, would be a problem CÃ¡novas became responsible for his education. So, he sent Alfonso to the Sandhurst Military Academy in England, where the training Alfonso received was severe but more cosmopolitan than Spain, given the current atmosphere.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \"In 1 December 1874, Alfonso issued the Sandhurst Manifesto, where he set the ideological basis of the Bourbon Restoration. It was drafted in reply to a birthday greeting from his followers, a manifesto proclaiming himself the sole representative of the Spanish monarchy. At the end of 1874, Brigadier MartÃ\\\\xadnez Campos, who had long been working more or less openly for the king, led some battalions of the central army to Sagunto, rallied to his own flag the troops sent against him, and entered Valencia in the king\\'s name. Thereupon the President resigned, and his power was transferred to the king\\'s plenipotentiary and adviser, Antonio CÃ¡novas. The 29 December 1874 military coup of Gen. Martinez Campos in Sagunto ended the failed republic and meant the rise of the young Prince Alfonso.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Return from exile==\\\\n\\', \\'Alfonso XII in the uniform of the Supreme Commander of the Spanish Navy.\\\\n\\', \\'5 Peseta of Alfonso XII\\\\n\\', \"Within a few days after Canovas del Castillo took power as Premier, the new king, proclaimed on 29 December 1874, arrived at Madrid, passing through Barcelona and Valencia and was acclaimed everywhere (1875). In 1876, a vigorous campaign against the Carlists, in which the young king took part, resulted in the defeat of Don Carlos and the Duke\\'s abandonment of the struggle.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Initially led by Canovas del Castillo as moderate prime minister, what was thought at one time as a coup aimed at placing the military in the political-administrative positions of power, in reality ushered in a permanent civilian regime that lasted until the 1931 Second Republic. CÃ¡novas was the real architect of the new regime of the Restoration.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"In order to eliminate one of the problems of the reign of Isabel II, the single party and its destabilizing consequences, the Liberal Party was allowed to incorporate and participate in national politics, and the \\'turnismo\\' or alternation was to become the new system. Turnismo would be endorsed in the Constitution of 1876 and the Pact of Pardo Palace (1885). It meant that a liberal and conservative prime ministers would succeed each other ending thus the troubles.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'This led to the end of the Carlist revolts and the victory over the New York-backed Cuban revolutionaries, and led to a huge backing both by insular and peninsular Spaniards of Alfonso as a wise and able king.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Alfonso\\'s short reign established the foundations for the final socioeconomic recuperation of Spain after the 1808â\\\\x80\\\\x931874 crisis. Both European (the coastal regions, such as the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Asturias) and Overseas â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Antilles and Pacific were able to grow steadily. Cuba and Puerto Rico prospered to the point that Spain\\'s first train was between Havana and Camaguey, and the world\\'s first telegraph was in Puerto Rico, as Samuel Morse lived there with his daughter, married to a Puerto Rican businessman. Upon the American invasion of Puerto Rico, 10 US dollars were needed to buy 1 Puerto Rican peso.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'On 23 January 1878 at the Basilica of Atocha in Madrid, Alfonso married his first cousin, Princess Maria de las Mercedes, daughter of Antoine, Duke of Montpensier, but she died within six months of the marriage.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Second marriage and rule==\\\\n\\', \\'Alfonso XII and his second wife Maria Christina of Austria, 1885.\\\\n\\', \\'On 29 November 1879 at the Basilica of Atocha in Madrid, Alfonso married a much more distant relative, Maria Christina of Austria, daughter of Archduke Karl Ferdinand of Austria and of his wife Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria.

Born posthumously. He married Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In 1881 Alfonso refused to sanction a law by which the ministers were to remain in office for a fixed term of 18 months. Upon the consequent resignation of Canovas del Castillo, he summoned PrÃ¡xedes Mateo Sagasta, the Liberal leader, to form a new cabinet.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Death and impact==\\\\n\\', \"Funeral procession of Alfonso XII, from the 5 December 1885, issue of L\\'Illustration\\\\n\", \\'Monument to Alfonso XII, erected in 1922 in the Parque del Buen Retiro, Madrid.\\\\n\\', \\'In November 1885, Alfonso died, just short of his 28th birthday, at the Royal Palace of El Pardo. He had been suffering from tuberculosis, but the immediate cause of his death was a recurrence of dysentery. \"Death of the King of Spain\", The Times (26 November 1885): 7. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"In 1902, his widow Maria Cristina initiated a national contest to build a monument in memory of Alfonso. The winning design, by JosÃ© Grases Riera, was erected in an artificial lake in Madrid\\'s Parque del Buen Retiro in 1922.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Coming to the throne at such an early age, Alfonso had served no apprenticeship in the art of ruling, but he possessed great natural tact and a sound judgment ripened by the trials of exile. Benevolent and sympathetic in disposition, he won the affection of his people by fearlessly visiting districts ravaged by cholera or devastated by earthquake in 1885. His capacity for dealing with men was considerable, and he never allowed himself to become the instrument of any particular party. During his short reign, peace was established both at home and abroad, finances were well regulated, and the various administrative services were placed on a basis that afterwards enabled Spain to pass through the disastrous war with the United States without the threat of a revolution.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Illegitimate issue==\\\\n\\', \\'Alfonso had two sons by Elena Armanda Nicolasa Sanz y MartÃ\\\\xadnez de Arizala (CastellÃ³n de la Plana, 15 December 1849 â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Paris, 24 December 1898):\\\\n\\', \\'* Alfonso Sanz y MartÃ\\\\xadnez de Arizala (28 January 1880, Madrid â\\\\x80\\\\x93 1970), married in 1922 to MarÃ\\\\xada de Guadalupe de Limantour y Mariscal (d. 1977, Marbella), daughter of Julio de Limantour y Marquet (17 June 1863, Mexico City â\\\\x80\\\\x93 11 October 1909, Mexico City) and wife Elena Mariscal y ..., paternal granddaughter of French Joseph Yves de Limantour y Rence de la Pagame (1812, Ploemeur â\\\\x80\\\\x93 1885, Mexico City) and wife AdÃ¨le Marquet y Cabannes (1820, Bordeaux â\\\\x80\\\\x93 ?), and maternal granddaughter of Ignacio Mariscal y ...
